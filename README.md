Takes autogenerated subtitles (from YouTube or other such tool)
and massages them into normal-looking English.

for easy online access.

## Development

This is a pure Dart web app. To run, debug, build, etc., use 
[`webdev`](https://dart.dev/tools/webdev). If you're using an IDE like
WebStorm, with a Dart plugin, this will all work out of the box.

To build and publish to GitHub Pages:

    peanut && git push origin --set-upstream gh-pages

(You'll need `peanut` installed, with something like 
`pub global activate peanut`.)
